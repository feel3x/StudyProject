Log in on the front page under “Login for Attendees”.

Supervise Discipline:
Find the respective Discipline (example: “Round 1”) under “Competitions”→”Name of
Competition”→ “Name of Discipline”.
From here you can find a Button called “Supervise Discipline”. (If the account holds the
necessary permissions.)
In the new Window the discipline can be supervised. This means, it can be started/paused.
This is also where the current athlete needs to be chosen in order for the judges to judge
them. Only the currently chosen athlete is unlocked for judging!
With the right arrow the next athlete in line will be selected for judging. With the left arrow you
can revert to the previous athlete.
You can also get insight into which judge has submitted their score and who is still missing.
Always make sure the right athlete is selected!
I suggest that a sperate person such as Trish supervises the discipline.

Judging:
Once the judge is logged in, they can find the respective Discipline (example: “Round 1”)
under “Competitions” → “Name of Competition” → “Name of Discipline”.
From here you can find a Button called “Judge”. (If the account holds the necessary
permissions.)
In the new Window the current athlete can be judged. Simply slide the slider to the desired
score and hit “submit”. With “Revoke” the score can be revoked and then resubmitted. This
window should automatically move on to the next athlete as soon as the “Supervisor” has
switched athletes. If for any reason it is not switching to the next athlete, please close
and re-open the judging window!
Judges can also find a Button called “Criteria Cheatsheet” where they find tips from the FTA
about how to judge properly.

Startlist:
Find the respective Discipline (example: “Round 1”) under “Competitions” → “Name of
Competition” → “Name of Discipline”.
From here you can find a Button called “View Start List”. In the new window you can see the
startlist for the respective discipline.
There is a printer icon at the top left, where the startlist can easily be printed.
If “autoscroll” is checked, the windwow will automatically scroll to the athlete currently at turn.
To find the startlist for the next Round/Discipline, press the back button and find the new
discipline (example: Round 2).

Scoreboard:
Find the respective Discipline (example: “Round 1”) under “Competitions” → “Name of
Competition” → “Name of Discipline”.
From here you can find a Button called “View Scoreboard”. In the new window you can see
the scoreboard for the respective discipline.

Copying Athletes:
Open the scoreboard for the finished discipline. From here you can check athletes (for
example the first 5) at the checkbox next to their name on the left. Once checked you can
“Copy” them to another Discipline (example: Round 2). To do that simply choose the desired
competition name and then the desired discipline name and submit by pressing “Copy #
Members”. (This only works if you have the necessary permissions. Judges will not be able
to copy members!)

Notes:
Members can open notes and save them for later.

Windows:
Multiple windows can be arranged to personal preference of each user.

Manage Members:
Members can be added, edited and deleted from here.
To add a member, fill out all the information. If only one name is desired, please use “last
name” and leave “first name” blank. If the member is an athlete. Please choose the “Athlete”
permission preset. Same goes for a judge.
Members can be edited and added to competitions and disciplines.
The manage members feature still needs to be refined and contains some glitches.
Please only use when necessary for now!
